===============

My first trial on a RL problem for the game Fluid Plasma Pong. 
I'm using the HTML replication of the Plasma Pong made by http://anirudhjoshi.github.com/fluid_table_tennis.

This work is currently in progress. For now, the Gym environment is created and the connection between the html page and the alogrithm is operationnal. The first and only algorithm tried for now is the PPO and is able to take actions. The reward table must be adapted to allow a satisfying training.
